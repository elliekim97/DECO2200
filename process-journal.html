                <p>Expert consensus is that autonomous cars will be in general regular usage by 2027 with specific use cases live before then (Bainbridge, 2018).
                  Much of the public focus on this new technology has been on autonomous cars replacing the transit tasks undertaken by personally owned and driven cars,
                  human driven taxis and airport shuttles.
                	<br><br>
                  Together with my fellow group members Salma and Ben, our team explored the problem area of non-native speaking users of public transport in Sydney.
                  This involved researching immigrants, tourists and international students and how they navigated around the city of Sydney.
                	<br>
<br>
                  Our team aimed to tackle these issues in the development of our concept, leading up to the creation of paper and low-fidelity prototypes.

                  We then collaborated to create a mobile application for the autonomous tourist bus service; the AUTOURBUS.

                  In the first lecture of the semester led by Hamish, we were told about the difference between a good and a bad user interface design.
                  It must be a "visible, audible, tactile, gustatory or olfactory point of contact between the user and the computer."
                  The objectives and the context of the design project assignments together align to reveal that we should have a good understanding
                  of a UCD process, prototyping skills, group collaboration and most importantly the interactivity between humans and autonomous vehicles.

                  With the self-driving cars slowly becoming a reality due to the advancements in technology and AI, this idea was quite a new yet old concept to me;
                  because

                    a) I'm sure everyone (at one point of their life) has thought about the possibility of a driverless or flying car operated by robots one day

                  b) Companies like Uber are actually aiming to have flying cars by 2020
                  <br><br>
                  <i>However</i><br>
            <br> c) Autonomous cars are still being tested and they can't guarantee 100% safety - there has been fatality incidents in  Florida (Tesla in 2016), Arizona (Uber in 2018)
	                   <br><br> d) Only a small percentage of people in the world are convinced that a robot is a better driver than a human being. People don't fully trust a driverless vehicle yet!
                     <br><br>
                   John Preston and Ben Waterson, researcher and lecturer at the University of Southampton states in their article <b>"Transport’s innovation problem: why haven’t flying cars taken off?" (2015) </b>that:   <br><i>"…transport is not just about technology. It is also about people – and people don’t always like change."</i>.
                   <br> With this in mind, I posed the following questions which I aim to focus on throughout the assessments:
	                 <br>1. What is the purpose of an autonomous vehicle?
  	                <br>2. What are some existing vehicles in the market that has been successful? What can we learn from them?
		                  <br>3. What level of outcome would users want to achieve from choosing a robot over a human driver?
		                    <br>4. How will I design an innovative interface that displays good GUI and interaction design - by tackling the current issues people have with autonomous vehicles?

                <p>In this week's tutorial we focused on identifying our stakeholders. It is important to understand who they are as it
                  allows to have an idea of our future potential users and what we'd have to focus on to improve their overall experience.
                <br>
                The diagram below shows some of our key stakeholders; the users in the middle rely on vehicles the most.

              <p>
                During this brainstorming activity, we identified users who may face language barriers while utilising these products. There were a variety of users such as tourists, immigrants or international students who may not fully engage with the product due to their limited English language proficiency.
            <br>
            Although we have our focus on users in Sydney, because English is not the only language used, we decided to focus
             our problem on: Non-native (English) speakers finding it difficult to navigate around Sydney.
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we moved on, we spoke to Sophie about the kind of research questions to identify. We identified them as:
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>What problems do non-native speakers encounter while travelling around?</li>
            <li>What are they currently doing to fix that problem?</li>
            <li>What does a typical trip look like for a non-native speaker?</li>
            <li>What modes of transport do they currently use?</li>
          <li>How do non-native speaking users navigate?</li>
<li>What apps and devices do commuters use to assist their commuting experience?</li>
<li>Other people?</li>
<li>Physical environment - Signage?</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Our intended impact:</b> How will research findings impact the project?
<br>
These research findings should reveal problems that non-native speakers encounters in navigating around Sydney.

                <p>In this week, my group members and I brainstormed some potential questions we could ask our target research market of non-native speakers. Using Martin Tomitsch's Design. Think. Make. Break. Repeat book, we chose the interview, questionnaire, contextual observation and bodystorming method to further examine the user's behaviours.
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The interview would be carried out without a time limit therefore users are free to express what is on their mind </li>
                        <li> The questionnaire would allow us to gather many data in a short period of time </li>
                          <li> Contextual observation lets users behave freely without any restrictions therefore is a very natural and unbiased result </li>
                          <li> And lastly the bodystorming allows us to think and create a storyboard on how our target users would react if placed in a real life situation. </li>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          We then divided our work into 3 and I was assigned to conduct my research on tourists. I was responsible in carrying out the interview, observation and bodystorming methods on these users.
                          B<br>Below were the interview questions I asked my users:
                          <br><br> <br>

<p>
  As I made the effort to search for tourists, it was very difficult especially because I worked alone. I had to speak in 3 different languages - Korean, English and a little bit of Indonesian to interview these tourists properly.
<br>
After interviewing and observing users, I came up with 5 different scenarios for our bodystorming. Below are photos of these scenarios:
<ol>
  <li>User gets on the transport and accidentally leaves her belonging behind when getting off. She is desperate to get them back but has no idea what to do. She is very unfamiliar with the Sydney transport system on top of her poor English skills which do not allow her to speak to staff members properly.</li>
	<li>User gets on the transport and casually goes on her mobile device. She gets distracted and almost misses her stop. She tries to communicate with the driver that she needs to get off but fails to and therefore officially passes by her stop. </li>
	<li>User is waiting for her train. She recently just heard about the TripView app that she can use to conveniently travel around Sydney however as she opens the app she realises that they are all in English. She sees a red sign saying that there are delays but has no idea how and why this situation is happening. She stays still in confusion and frustration.</li>
	<li>User hops on the transport and sees passengers causing a nuisance, fighting and swearing at each other. One passenger is left hurt and user wants to help but has no idea what to communicate to him.</li>
	<li>User got on the transport after thinking she successfully tapped on her opal card. The transport officer gets on, asks for her card and shows her that she did not tap on therefore will be fined $200. User is shocked and does not know what to do.</li>

To extrapolate further from the data set, a user persona was ideated to allow us to engage with the needs of the user, as well as including their voice in all phases of the design process. The interview data was plotted on a spectrum to assist in visualising what a typical user could look like.

                <p>Our findings from our individual reports were pooled together to be analysed as a whole. Some interesting points that arose were:<br>
                <ul>
  <li>Driving in Sydney is stressful, and so Public Transport is a better alternative </li>
  <li>Due to unfamiliarity, users aren't sure when to get on and off</li>
  <li>Users are heavily reliant on phone to navigate (as opposed to kiosks and signage)</li>
  <li>Users are wary of using autonomous vehicles, only if it's a guaranteed fact that it is safe  - Users don't rely on one app - they use a combination of TripView, NextThere or GoogleMaps, depending on what service they're using </li>
  <li>Migrants would still rather use English service in order to learn the language </li>
  <li>Need for visual and audible stimulation.</li>
</ul></p>
<br><p>
From this, we created an objective:<i> <b>Develop an interaction with autonomous vehicles that eases stress and eliminates confusion for non-native speaking tourists navigating around Sydney.</b></i>This is a statement we will refer back to throughout the design process, to ensure that we will meet the user’s need and wants to create the best possible solution.</p>

                <p>We continued to develop our concepts, implementing methods such as Brain-writing 635 and Leapfrogging. The Brain writing 635 method is a brainstorming technique allowed us to think outside the box and develop a medley of concepts. Leapfrogging was an interesting method of pulling out two completely different ideas and creating a concept out of the two mediums together.<br>

After this, we concluded on three ideas, and assigned each person to develop the concept further.<br>
<ul><li> Autonomous Tour Bus App (Salma)</li>
<li> Autonomous Tour Bus Kiosk (Ellie)</li>
<li> Autonomous Tour Vehicle (Ben)</li></ul></p>

                <p>This week was spent creating sketches of our app. A large number of rough sketches were made, and tested on users so that they can gain a feel of the app. These apps were put through POP. We tested on other students in the Wilkinson building, employing the think-aloud protocol to gain insights to their attitude towards certain features of the app. We gave the user a scenario and asked them to use the app accordingly, and they succeeded in doing so. It was made clear that our concept was running smoothly.

            <p> As the users thought-aloud while they were interacting with the paper prototypes, observations were also made. Things we picked up upon were where their fingers hovered towards, or where did their eyes look at first. It was clear that the participants looked for headings and visual cues. It was also made apparent that the navigation bar had <i>too</i> many icons, and that the boxes are too small for them to click. We then thought into account the potential of streamlining the navigation bar, as this will also avoid confusion yet declutter the aesthetic.</p></div></div>

Research of aesthetic quality was conducted through Dribbble, Behance & Sketch Resources. Our team concluded that we wanted to evoke Australia through the colours of yellow and green.<br>

                <p>Several iterations of our interface was created as discrepencies arose within our group member's personal style. Little details such as typeface and positioning of elements were factors of dispute, however, the group came together and made decisions as a consensus. Some obstacles we encountered was colour palette, as the yellow and the vibrancy of green that we chose clashed with the white. In future, I will consider thinking out the aesthetic and colour palette much earlier on in the design process. By far the most tedious, and time consuming task that we had to do was linking and adding all the transitions from screen to screen on invision especially due to the having so many screens (257) - however, Ellie pulled an all nighter and managed to come through. Some feedback from both Hollie and Sophie were "That's sick" and "Awesome work!".<br>

<p>Then, I created our compation website which can be accessed <u><a href="https://salmaira1.github.io/DECO2200/companion-website.html">here</a></u>. The website was somewhat tedious to complete, as my coding skills are subpar - however, with the help of Hamish, Will and Sophie, minor bugs were fixed. The video walkthrough was the final task, which involved writing the script, recording and editing the video all together.  </p>
